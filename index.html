 <p>Accidents can happen while your data is traversing the LAN the local router reads the information and if needed will take it to another network. The router can make a mistake but it can be rare, after the router it is sent to the router switch which sends data one of two places. As they arrive at their location they are sent over to a proxy to for both taking a load off of the internet and for security reasons. Each packets is different in size depending on its content. The proxy then opens the packet and looks for a web address or URL depending on if the URL is acceptable. For those which pass the URL check they go back on the road to the next location, the firewall. The corporate firewall stops the viruses from going onto the server and stops sensitive data leaving. </p>
